Stopped their fuel-supply plan, arrested their ransomware gang, prevented massive phishing campaigns and understood their tactics and techniques in depth. Now it is the time for the final blow. The final preparations are completed. Everyone is in their stations waiting for the signal. This mission can only be successful if you use the element of surprise. Thus, the signal must remain a secret until the end of the operation. During some last-minute checks you notice some weird behaviour in Miyuki's PC. You must find out if someone managed to gain access to her PC before it's too late. If so, the signal must change. Time is limited and there is no room for errors.

Phalcon is running out of fuel and we need to stop at the nearest space station to refuel. The closest one is the B1-4S3D station, where we are unfortunately banned from docking our ship. Our surveillance showed that the station uses two OCR cameras to read the unique ID of each spaceship entering. The first one is used as a validator for the second one. We've managed to find a way to disable the validation process for a split second while our ship passes, but we still need to pass through the second camera. Furthermore, our lead hacker opened a connection with the second camera, which we can use to upload our custom model weights. Try to find a way to change the predictions of the model when we pass through the second gate. Be careful though, the other four spaceships that are in front of us need to be ID'd correctly so no suspicion raises.",
