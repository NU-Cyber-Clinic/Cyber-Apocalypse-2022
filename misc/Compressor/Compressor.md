Connect using netcat

Greeted with a menu and then enter one of the components

From there I ran the list direcotry and we can see we are in `/home/ctf/xxxx/component`

So guessing the flag is in `/home/ctf/flag.txt` i picked the cat/read artifact option and typed in `../../flag.txt` as the path and got the flag
```
HTB{GTFO_4nd_m4k3_th3_b35t_4rt1f4ct5}
```
